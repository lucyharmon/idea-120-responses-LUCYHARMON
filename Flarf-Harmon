I’ve been thinking
Under dark blue skies
What fear feels like
At your lowest point
To not lock the door
Or wipe tears in the eyes of strangers

I’ve been feeling
Like a fool
Ask him to break me a hundred
On my solemn drive home
Silence my cellphone

I’ve been meaning
To thank you for dinner
Blue and black leather 
In my closet forever
