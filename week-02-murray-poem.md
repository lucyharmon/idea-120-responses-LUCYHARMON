The pursuit of technology is the pursuit of magic

The pursuit of storytelling, a mirror of our world that attempts to dig deeper than what only our eyes can see

Technology tells us how far we would like our imagination to go

So we never have to question when the right moment is to stop.

We follow the stream of innovation, floating upon the rafts of medium as we go.
